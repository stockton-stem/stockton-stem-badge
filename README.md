# Stockton STEM Collaborative badge

## Introduction

This project provides a simple electronic device that students of varying
ability, with some supervision, should be able to assemble within about half
an hour. The targeted materials cost of each badge is less than US$10.

The printed circuit board is made to resemble the Stockton STEM logo in the
form of a badge with LEDs in place of the colored circles.

The device is sophisticated enough that more advanced students should then be
able to modify its functions using the source code in this repository, the
free version of the development software and an inexpensive device programming
tool.

# System Description

The microcontroller in this project, a MicroChip PIC12LF1501, is a small 8-pin
device with a number of hardware features. It was selected for this project
specifically because of both its size and having four PWM peripherals, and
because, like many PIC devices, it is cheap and fairly power efficient.

The circuit for the project uses four differently colored LEDs (and associated
current-limiting resistors), a button, and is powered by a coin-cell battery.
Two capacitors provide decoupling and bulk storage; the latter helps reduce
smooth the otherwise bursty current draw of the LEDs from the battery. The
board has locations to optionally also provide an ICSP programming header and
pull-up resistor.

The code for this project is divided roughly across a handful of source files.
`main.c` contains the basic hardware device initialization and the interrupt
handler. `badge.c` and `badge.h` contains the code with LED patterns in it.
Various configuration details are kept in `config.h` (Peripheral setup values,
for example to setup the timers and PWMs) and `pic_config.h` (PIC startup
values).


## System clock

The internal CPU clock (Fosc) is configured to run at 1MHz. At a later stage
the clock may be configured at a lower rate to reduce battery consumption,
though all downstream modules driven by this clock then need to be considered
and their values amended.


## PWM modules

The four PWM peripherals drive the pins that the LEDs are wired to. Pulse-
width modulation enables the project to control the brightness of the LEDs.
Each PWM peripheral has its own duty-cycle value which sets the brightness.
The four PWM modules share the same clock input which is generated by the
Timer 2 peripheral. This is in turn sourced from the internal oscillator
though a divider. These are configured to provide a 16.26ms PWM period (about
600KHz). In future, reducing the system clock will reduce this PWM clock;
LEDs may use less, or more, power with a slower PWM period and this should
be investigated.


## Idle shutdown

Timer 1 is setup to generate an interrupt every two seconds and is driven from
a seperate internal oscillator that runs at 32KHz. The interrupts are counted
and after RUN_INTERVAL seconds (see `config.h`) the project is powered off.
This involves disabling the PWM modules, turning off the LEDs, disabling any
interrupts that might wake the device prematurely and then putting the system
to sleep. In this state the processor uses the least amount of power possible;
a fresh CR2032 battery might last more than two years at this power level.


## The button

Any interrupt can wake the device from sleep if it is left configured when
going to sleep and any associated peripheral remains running when sleeping.

The input pin that the button is attached to is configured to "interrupt on
change"; this mode will survive sleeping. Should the input line change when
asleep the system resumes from where it left of; the code re-initializes the
hardware and then the progrm continues as normal.

The interrupt also triggers during normal operation when the button is
pressed; this does two things:

* It resets the runtime counter, thus extending the time the project will
  run for.
* It is also used to cycle through the various LED patterns available.

To de-bounce the input from the button, Timer 0 is setup to run once when the
button interrupt fires. Timer 0 is setup to generate an interrupt in about 4ms
after being started, typically enough time for any noisy input signals from
the button to have finised; each subsequent noisy input resets the Timer 1
counter. Once the Timer 1 counter completes, its interrupt then causes the LED
pattern to cycle by incrementing the pattern number.


## LED patterns

LED patterns are produced by a function that is expected to set the state of
the LEDs once and then return; advancing to the next LED state the next time
it is called. In this way cycling through different LED patterns is just a
matter of the dispatching code sitting in a loop and on each iteration
checking which pattern should be running and calling the appropriate function.
Presently this dispatch is performed in a `switch` statement; value `0` calls
`iterate_basic_ramp`, value `1` calls another function, etc. In future a
function table may work better.


## Future thoughts

In future, power reduction may be realized by replacing the current per-
iteration spin-style sleep (that is, the processor executes dummy instructions
in a loop until the correct amount of time has passed) with a system sleep
that is woken up by Timer 0 after N-milliseconds, though in the scheme of
things the amount of power consumed by the processor is tiny  compared to the
LEDs.


# Firmware build tools

Several tools, a mixture of hardware and software, are needed to develop,
build and install new code onto the PIC processor.


## MPLAB-X

* TODO add URL

This is an integrated development environment (IDE) from MicroChip. It is
available for Linux, MacOS X and for Windows.


## XC 8 compiler

* TODO add URL

This is a proprietary compiler from MicroChip designed for their 8-bit PIC
series. It integates effortlessly with the MPLAB-X IDE. It is available for
Linux, MacOS X and for Windows.

The paid-for license enables enhanced compiler optimizations that can reduce
the produced firmware image size and the code may run more efficiently; whilst
nice these are not needed for this project and thus the free license is
perfectly adequate.


## Device programming/debugging

To program new code onto the PIC a programmer is necessary. MicroChip have
their own mechanism for this known as ISCP; either one of the two programmers
below will suffice for this. Note that older PICkit 2 programmers, or those
that are PICkit 2 compatible, will not work on the PIC in this project.

This particular PIC chip also does not have a built-in debugger; for that an
external module is required in addition to one of the programmers below; this
is strictly optional.

When a programmer is connected the push-button may not always work as
expected; given the low pin count of the processor two of the signals needed
for ICSP are shared with other functions; for this project that means one LED
and the button. When programming you may notice the green LED flashing. Some
programmers hold the line used for the button low after programming thus
interferes with its operation.

Whatever programmer is used, ensure that it is configured with a target
voltage of 3.0v. The current limiting resistors of the LEDs are chosen
with the 3v supplied by a button cell in mind; any more than this can
damage the LEDs.

### PICkit 3

* TODO add URL

This USB device is a basic ICSP PIC programmer that typically retails for
$50US though cheaper versions, of varying authenticity, are available on Ebay
and elsewhere for $10-$20.

The pull-up resistor R5 is required for this programmer to function correctly.

### ICD 3

* TODO add URL

This is an enhanced ICSP PIC programmer and debugger. It is faster and can
provide more power to target boards; it is also much more expensive at about
US$200.

Empirical observations suggest that the pull-up resistor R5 may be optional
for this programmer to function correctly.

### (debugging module)

* TODO add model and URL

This is not strictly necessary but it can often aid debugging new code if a
hardware debugger is available. This device sells for US$50. You insert it
into the target board _instead_ of the normal PIC and the programmer then
plugs into this debugging module. It only provides a single hardware
breakpoint but given the simplicity of this project that should prove
sufficient for most debugging.

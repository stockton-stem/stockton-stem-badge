# Stockton STEM Collaborative badge

## Introduction

This project provides a simple electronic device that students of varying
ability, with some supervision, should be able to assemble within half an
hour. The targeted materials cost of each badge is less than US$10.

The printed circuit board is made to resemble the Stockton STEM logo in
the form of a badge.

The device is sophisticated enough that more advanced students should then
be able to modify its functions using the source code in this repository, the
free version of the development software and an inexpensive device programming
tool.

## Scope

Components:

* Printed circuit board.
* 8-pin microcontroller chip.
* Capacitor.
* Resistors.
* LEDs of different colors.
* Coin-cell battery.

## Progress

First approximations of code and circuit are committed to this repository.
They are far from final, but here's some pictures of the progress:
